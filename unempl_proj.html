                Understanding the relationship between crime rates and unemployment is crucial for developing effective
                social and
                economic policies. This project delves deep into the intricate dynamics between these two significant
                factors across
                various states in the USA. By employing javascript library for visualizing data, we aim to uncover
                patterns
                and
                correlations that are not immediately apparent in raw data. This exploration is particularly relevant in
                the
                current
                socio-economic climate, where fluctuations in employment rates and concerns about public safety are at
                the
                forefront of
                policy discussions. By examining how changes in unemployment rates impact crime rates, this project
                seeks to
                provide
                valuable insights that can inform more targeted and effective interventions.

                This visualization focuses on a state-by-state analysis to capture the diverse socio-economic landscapes
                across the
                United States. Different states exhibit varying levels of unemployment and crime, influenced by factors
                such
                as economic
                conditions, demographic composition, and local policies. By leveraging a range of data visualization
                tools and libraries,
                we will
                highlight these regional differences and explore potential causal relationships. The insights gained
                from
                this project
                will not only contribute to academic and policy-making discussions but also support community leaders
                and
                stakeholders
                in crafting strategies to combat unemployment and reduce crime.

                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Data preprocessing:</p>
                In our unemployment rates database, we gathered monthly data for each state and calculated the yearly
                average to give a
                clearer picture of unemployment over the year. We also added a column showing the percentage of the
                population that's
                unemployed. This was done by dividing the total number of unemployed people in each state by the total
                civilian
                non-institutional population and multiplying by 100.
                <br>
                The database is simple and easy to use, with just two columns: state name and the calculated
                unemployment percentage.
                This makes it straightforward to find and understand the key information.
